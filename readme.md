# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data to extract valuable insights related to pricing, availability, and host performance. The analysis addresses key business questions through data cleaning, modeling, and visualization using Power BI, SQL, and Python.

## Data Cleaning

The data underwent thorough preprocessing to ensure accuracy and reliability for analysis. Key steps included:
1. **Checking Data Types** – Verified the correctness of data types to avoid inconsistencies.
2. **Handling Null Values** – Addressed missing data through appropriate imputation or removal strategies.
3. **Data Modeling** – Created a structured and optimized data model suitable for querying and visualization.

## Business Questions

The analysis aimed to answer several critical business questions, including:
- **Average Price** – Determine the mean price of listings.
- **Price Distribution** – Visualize how prices vary across different properties.
- **Price Distribution by Location** – Analyze pricing trends based on geographic location.
- **Price Categories** – Classify listings into price ranges.
- **Average Price per Room Type** – Calculate the average price for different room categories.
- **Room Type Count** – Count the number of listings per room type.
- **Superhost Percentage** – Determine the percentage of superhosts in the dataset.
- **Average Review Score** – Calculate the average score from customer reviews.
- **Cleanliness and Communication Ratings** – Assess host performance based on cleanliness and communication ratings.
- **Availability Metrics** – Calculate:
  - **Total Available Days**
  - **Total Unavailable Days**
  - **Availability Percentage**
- **Minimum and Maximum Nights** – Analyze the average minimum and maximum stay requirements.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Power Query** – Data import and transformation.
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Python** – Data analysis and visualization:
  - **Pandas** – Data manipulation.
